# FamilyApp
A networking and keep-up-to-date app for families. It's purpose is twofold. Primarily it serves as a sandbox for me to practice skills. Secondarily, it is a repository for photos and messages and events for my family.

The app utilizes a Node.js + Express server, Angular frontend, and Mongoose DB.
